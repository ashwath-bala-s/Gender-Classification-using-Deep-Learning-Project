# Gender Classification using Deep Learning Project

**Introduction:**

Gender classification is a fundamental task in various applications, including targeted advertising, customer segmentation, and human-computer interaction. By accurately determining a person's gender based on visual or other data, businesses and developers can tailor experiences, products, and services more effectively. This project aims to leverage deep learning techniques to classify gender from images, using neural networks to capture and learn complex patterns in the data.

**Problem Statement:**

The objective of this project is to develop a deep learning model that accurately classifies gender based on image data. By training a neural network on a diverse dataset of images, the model will learn to identify features and patterns associated with different genders.

**Dataset:**

In this project, we have used the following data:

(i) train.zip - Contains a CSV file ("train.csv") and 1 folder containing image data ("images")

(a) train.csv - [‘image_names’, ‘class’] - Contains the image name and correct class for 12196 train images

(b) images (folder) - Contains images for both train and test sets

(ii) test.csv: [‘image_names’] - Contains the image names for 5227 images in the test set

**Project Descripton:**

• Performed Image Rescaling and Image Augmentation Techniques before loading the images.

• Developed, compiled, and trained a deep learning model for image classification based on gender.

• Implemented Early Stopping, Model Checkpointing to optimize performance. 

• Achieved an model accuracy of 72%

**Skills:** Deep Learning · Image Pre-Preprocessing · Image Rescaling · Image Augmentation · Model Compiling · Early Stopping · Model Checkpointing · Model Analysis
